# PythonCode
In this section, I present overall data analysis/development using Python for a range of data. These elaborations are part of larger data engineering projects and include ETL, data exploration, data cleaning, calculations, visualizations and web scraping. I hope you can find good use in them and get inspired to grow in the world of Big Data.
